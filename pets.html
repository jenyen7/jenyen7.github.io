	<p>The Bengal cat is a cat breed from the leopard cat and other domestic cats.</p><br>
	<h2>Health</h2>
	<p>Bengal cats have several genetic diseases. One of the most common genetic disorder is Hypertrophic
	cardiomyopathy, so called HCM. <br>The disease will cause the heart muscle to be abnormally thick, reducing 
	its capacity to pump blood.</p>
	<h2>Care</h2>
	<p>We can take care of bengal cats like we take care of other dometic cats. It is suggested to put more
	cat trees in the house because these cats really love to climb.</p>
